This repository includes a R script 'run_analysis.R' which will take the 
UCI HAR test and training data sets and combine them, selecting a subset of
the variables pertaining to means and standard deviations.

The script has a single argument (with default value) to define the archived (.zip) data set; if this file or the extracted directory do not exist it is downloaded and extracted if necessary. The script then reads the features and class labels files to enrich the test and training data sets which are combined. The
